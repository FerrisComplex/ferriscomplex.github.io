High Priority
- Add viego spells to the database
- Add akshan spells to the database (just Q?)
- Add ZoeE to evade in traps (persistent dodge)
- Add InterrupterHelper.setupMenu(menucontroller) and InterrupterHelper.isEnabled(spellname)
- double check things like cait trap have evade hitboxes

Medium Priority
- v2 lineprediction is crashing (related to collision checks having a null pointer and stackoverflowing)
- allow harass in freeze button & logic

Low Priority
- do extreamly basic akshan script (+ add support for double auto in orbwalker based on is AIHeroClient && canReach(x, 0.5, 0.33) distance check (from garens helper list [make this a base MyLogic method]))
- Kalista needs to be tweaked (DiscordTodo.txt)
- Ezreal Q Logic needs better getFastPredictionTime() logic
- MF Extended Q needs to calculate from a cone not a triagle behind minions (use Clipper)
- MF ult should check if any enemies exist in ult & auto cancel if needed
- Fix skuttle spawn logic ( only 1 every x minutes not both ) [waiting on vino for timer fix in ensouls core]
- Add Invade & Counter invasion smite logic (seperated keybind to enable this feature)
