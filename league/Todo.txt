/** TODO **/

Add missing skins to skin changer selection db (may take a bit of time)
Add Proper names to skin changer chromas (skin before chroma -> skin id of next non chroma is the chorma skin name)
Add Yorick E to evade (its an emitter so troy it is)

Vex https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/event/vex-abilities-rundown/
Passive Wait for passive before engaging maybe?
(viego logic (w) for Q) [2 skillshots first + second for evade / prediction] if (pred1.HitChance >= High || pred2.HitChance >= High)
W (spell shield logic [copy from morg?] with checks for passive detonations during combo)
E just a circle pred 
R Logic same as varus + akali (R target -> E target -> Q target -> R recast -> W -> repeat spells)




Priority stuff
Create DelegateController with every ensoul delegate call in it
Change all scripts to use DelegateControllers delegates over ensouls and add if debugmode -> run things with timer
Add ability to add by priority to delegatecontroller to allow injecting things infront/behind other delegates
Add Optionals to turn off certain delegates easilly (delegate -= x by classpath on button maybe for things like activator/awareness to have sub categories to enable disable each function)

**Things that need testing**


**High priority Todo**
Do pass on all existing scripts and fix any bugs left and stupid logic in them *cough alistar* and quite a few others lol
Fix jinx Q logic in waveclear, fix jinx R logic in teamfights, jinx anti-gapcloser being slightly stupid
Semi Key for Snowball ARAM
Activator->Galeforce: Add enemy champs whitelist (exactly like it is done for Ignite usage) so u can choose on which enemy champs u don't want to use the item on. Sometimes there are some feeders/inters and its not worth spending 90sec cd on them :stuck_out_tongue:
 general request: can u make "Enable Spell Farm [J]" option also valid for jungle clearing? So when its set to off it wont use spells both in Lane and Jungle Clears. Right now this option works only for Lane Clear
for Zilean: Button in combo dont use Q unless W is up for combo/harass (IF Q is below 1s CD dont waste W)

Kindred
Should auto q. Currently q then autos
Doesnt use e in lane clear
Did q in jungle clear but only once at the start of that camp and never again?
E jungle clear needs to hit big hp target not the baby chickens
combo/harras seems like it doesnt spam q hard enough when in w range

if all on above list are finished at 91
leagues half way point being 78 xd


**Low Priority Todo**
Remove delegate calls during prediction swap rather than letting it run in the background 
^ Always leave FerrisV1 running as it uses QLearning to dynamically load its aprox list
Add all the missing skins to SkinChanger database + add Chroma names to the list of chromas 
Add InterrupterHelper.setupMenu(menucontroller) and InterrupterHelper.isEnabled(spellname)
Ignite should auto ignite if killable (When invulnerable ((damageTicks - invulnerable time) * damage > x.health + x.allShield + x.regen(damageTicks-invulnerableTime)))
Evade Irelia Dash logic needs to check for killable minions as priority, check non killable minions to avoid loss of reset
Add akshan Q extend logic to the database
Kalista needs to be tweaked (DiscordTodo.txt)
Ezreal Q Logic needs better getFastPredictionTime() logic
MF ult should check if any enemies exist in ult & auto cancel if needed
Fix skuttle spawn logic ( only 1 every x minutes not both ) [waiting on vino for timer fix in ensouls core]
Add Invade & Counter invasion smite logic (seperated keybind to enable this feature)

for miss fortune: 
1. add semi E-key 
2. add "Killable with R" notification drawing (with big font xD) 
3. Add W and Q usage option in Lane Clear 
4. Add casting E before R in semi-R key (more dmg from R if target is slowed)

for Samira: 
1. Looks like prediction cant distinguish if u are casting Q meele or Q range. Its important coz Q meele has no collision so it can be casted even when minions are between you and the target. Right now if u are on meele Q range and minions are standing between u and target, Q won't be casted. 
2. Add some W spell block logic (targeted spells for a start should be fine) 
3. Add Samira W to Evade Spells in Evade so u can block skillshots that are undodgable by foot

for Sivir: 
1. Add W usage  in harras (only after AA) 
2. Add targeted spells block with E

for Twtich: 
1. Add option in Combo to use W only after AA 
1b. Also an option not to cast W while R is active 
2. Add W usage in Lane Clear (with minimum minions hit slider) 
3. Add Antigapcloser with W

for Vayne: 
1. Add Antigapclosers list 
2. Add semi-E key

for Xayah: 
1. Add semi -R key 
2. Add option in Harras Q: "^ only after AA"
