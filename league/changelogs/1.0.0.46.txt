TODO
-------------------------
Fix Zeri Extended W (Wall beam) prediction

add ping ward options
> Only Ping New wards with Vision
> Only Ping Pinks (FOW optional? still scripty)
> Ping when ally is standing in ward & they are in a bush 
> Ping after x millis optional
> Grab ward caster & update last position on ward cast (x.buffs.caster should still function in fow) [only do when last seen time > 10 seconds to show aprox area & mark as last seen time starting as 5s for vision circle update]


Stuff to do later
-------------------------
add sion Q to evade (treq its a visual not an actual thing (also extend all directionals by 10 for full charge handling))
add option for irelia Q for using it on non marked/non reset targets as a use option (IE use Q to avoid = true : use Q non reset = false will say use Q if it can reset but not otherwise)
