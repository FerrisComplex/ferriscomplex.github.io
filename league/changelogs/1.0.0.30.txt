**Things that need testing**
Elise

**High priority Todo**
Do pass on all existing scripts and fix any bugs left and stupid logic in them *cough alistar* and quite a few others lol
Fix jinx Q logic in waveclear, fix jinx R logic in teamfights, jinx anti-gapcloser being slightly stupid
Fix shove to actually not check wait times
Semi Key for Snowball ARAM
Activator->Galeforce: Add enemy champs whitelist (exactly like it is done for Ignite usage) so u can choose on which enemy champs u don't want to use the item on. Sometimes there are some feeders/inters and its not worth spending 90sec cd on them :stuck_out_tongue:
Elise add Human & Spider Q to killsteal logic

**GOAL FINISH BY AUG 22!**

if all on above list are finished at 91
leagues half way point being 78 xd


**Low Priority Todo**
Remove delegate calls during prediction swap rather than letting it run in the background 
^ Always leave FerrisV1 running as it uses QLearning to dynamically load its aprox list
Add all the missing skins to SkinChanger database + add Chroma names to the list of chromas 

for Jinx: add Q (rocket) range drawing

For kog: 
1. add semi-E key 
2. add option to cast Q in combo only if in AA range 
3. add option to cast E backwards in antigapcloser (behind you)

for miss fortune: 
1. add semi E-key 
2. add "Killable with R" notification drawing (with big font xD) 
3. Add W and Q usage option in Lane Clear 
4. Add casting E before R in semi-R key (more dmg from R if target is slowed)

for Samira: 
1. Looks like prediction cant distinguish if u are casting Q meele or Q range. Its important coz Q meele has no collision so it can be casted even when minions are between you and the target. Right now if u are on meele Q range and minions are standing between u and target, Q won't be casted. 
2. Add some W spell block logic (targeted spells for a start should be fine) 
3. Add Samira W to Evade Spells in Evade so u can block skillshots that are undodgable by foot


**Potential changes (PBE)**
TODO (potential rework for rengar :( now i is sad tho its like the old rengar now) [Now on PBE]
TODO (potential rework for amumu) [Think it was removed from PBE so no clue whats happening with that one]
