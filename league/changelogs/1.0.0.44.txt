TODO for this update

remove killsteal on 
> Anivia passive up
> Zac passive up

add ping ward options
> Only Ping New wards with Vision
> Only Ping Pinks
> Ping when ally is standing in ward & they are in a bush 
> Ping after x millis

add sion Q to evade (treq its a visual not an actual thing (also extend all directionals by 10 for full charge handling))
add option for irelia Q for using it on non marked/non reset targets as a use option (IE use Q to avoid = true : use Q non reset = false will say use Q if it can reset but not otherwise)
