As a note this will be built/released on 12.4 with some core api changes

TODO
-------------------------
Fix Zeri Extended W (Wall beam) prediction
Fully rewrite orbwalker turret farming logic
Kayle use E lasthit when minion out of AA range


Stuff to do later
-------------------------
add sion Q to evade (treq its a visual not an actual thing (also extend all directionals by 10 for full charge handling))
add option for irelia Q for using it on non marked/non reset targets as a use option (IE use Q to avoid = true : use Q non reset = false will say use Q if it can reset but not otherwise)
