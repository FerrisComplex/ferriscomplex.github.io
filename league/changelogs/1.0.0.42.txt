Again this is still very much TODO
Beta testers have access to the build on x.24 please report bugs as usual on the REPO
Evade testing is still needed on circular skillshots please use CoreDebug.dll from the repo so i can grab actual stacktraces once its updated for newest league version 
Please avoid testing these with ExploitNative.dll its not worth using atm as many of the packet handlers are being moved to the new core & native so 99% of the bugs are broken now ill fix this next week
