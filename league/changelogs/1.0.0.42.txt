Move LastPosition to Drawing<Drawer,Updater> processing (this is gonna suck it might be better to rewrite it since its kinda held together with tape xd)
Move Waypoints to faster Updater logic for pathfinder & drawer cache
Move NetworkProxy to properlly MITM leagues network handler on new native (can use /Exploits/PCasting/GenericPacketCaster.cs as a testcase)
