Autohotfix ensures league/ensouls configs are correct to use the client
It also automatically downloads hotfix files when league runs mini-patches

Simply run it while the league client is open & logged in
Enable auto-hotfix and it will do the rest of the work needed

Should always remain updated with ensouls game version!
